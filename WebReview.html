          <div class="review-title">1. Introduction</div>
          For my website review I chose a company where I worked before called
          <a href="https://www.finn.auto/en-US" target="_blank">FINN</a>. FINN
          is a start-up from Germany that was established in 2019. Their
          business model is to provide a subscription model for cars.
          <br /><br /><strong>What does that mean?</strong> <br />In particular,
          you can order a car on the FINN website and it will be delivered to
          your doorstep. Insurance, maintenance, taxes, roadside assistance and
          much more are covered by the monthly subscription. The only thing left
          to pay for is the fuel or electricity for e-cars.

            FINN's website design is not only held minimalistic but also is also
            very functional. It shows important information such as voice of
            customers, popular brands, advantages using FINN and FAQs.

        <div class="review-title">3. Product List Page</div>
        Looking at the product list page (PLP) one can see there are many UX/UI
        design best practices used.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Navigation bar</strong> at the top is always visible gives
            high value to the user to navigate quickly and efficiently through
            the website
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Opportunities to see if one is logged in</strong> is useful
            to quickly access ones profile
          </li>
          <li>
            Useful and simple <strong>filter options</strong> to find relevant
            products quickly throughout the page is a must have
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Product cards</strong> only show most relevant information
            making skimming through the product quickly possible
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A sorting option</strong> helps to prioritize products
          </li>
        </ol>
        The PLP is designed to maximize efficiency, but also be minimalist and
        not overload information.

        <div class="review-container">
          <div class="review-title">4. Product Details Page</div>
          The product Detail Page (PDP) is also very well structured. It becomes
          apparent that the style is similar when looking into the clean design
          of e.g.
          <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">apple.com</a>.

          <p>Prominent features are:</p>
          <ul class="pdp-ul">
            <li>Breadcrumbs at the top</li>
            <li>Clear pictures of the product</li>
            <li>Visbility of all options while maintaining clarity</li>
            <li>Prominent Call To Action</li>
            <li>Advantages of the product as bullets</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

        <div class="review-title">5. Conclusion and recommendation</div>
        FINN achieved an intuitive, clean and usable website by following many
        design best practices. While going through the website, I didn't feel
        lost in any moment and felt that lots of thoughts are made where to put
        which information. My only recommendation would be to bring the website
        to the next level by introducing for example a Chat-Bot or a live Chat
        support.
